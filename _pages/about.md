My name is Elima Shehu. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the MathCoRe Research Training Group at [Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg](https://www.ovgu.de/en/Otto+von+Guericke+University+Magdeburg.rss).

I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the [University of Osnabrück](https://www.uni-osnabrueck.de/) in April 2024, under the supervision of [Paul Breiding](https://pbrdng.github.io/index.html). From 2021 to 2024, I was a doctoral researcher in the Emmy Noether Group at the University of Osnabrück, hosted by the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences (MPI MiS)](https://www.mis.mpg.de/institute/about-us).

My research lies at the intersection of Algebraic Geometry, Numerical Nonlinear Algebra, and Algebraic Statistics, with a particular focus on problems arising in Computer Vision—especially within the emerging field of Algebraic Vision.

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy spending time in nature, cooking diverse cuisines, and exploring new places through travel.
